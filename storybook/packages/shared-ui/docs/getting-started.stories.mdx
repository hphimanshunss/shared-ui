				Our documentation is public as it makes sharing and
				collaboration between different teams and third party vendors
				much easier as it increases the system's visibility and
				accountability. This also makes us push towards higher quality
				and enables us to be more transparent. Finally, it also serves
				as an amazing tool that we can leverage in recruiting.

			<h3 className="csb-block__title">How we work</h3>
			<p>
				The following set of fundamental rules allows us to get to the
				highest level of productivity while benefiting both the company
				and our team members.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					We avoid meetings as much as possible. Instead of having
					them, we communicate asynchronous to each other via Slack
					and Figma, expecting responses within 24 hours top.
				</li>
				<li>
					We don't do team wide standups or sync meetings, except one
					meeting at the start of every cycle. Here we walk through
					the tasks, discuss about how the team feels, what motivates
					them right now and what would they want to change.
				</li>
				<li>
					Most collaboration and discussion happens in feedback loops,
					using the above Atlassian tools like JIRA, which requires
					clear and thoughtful communication from everyone.
				</li>
				<li>
					We don't have strict deadlines. We ship incrementally as we
					move through the backlog and cycles in JIRA and launch new
					things as they become ready.
				</li>
				<li>
					Our team members should be able to work on what they think
					is fun, or rely on their intuition when picking tasks from
					the backlog. Our <strong>design system roadmap</strong>{' '}
					holds us accountable.
				</li>
				<li>We focus on persistent iteration over flashy launches.</li>
