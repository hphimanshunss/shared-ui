				Shared UI aims to improve WPMU DEV's products' UI consistency and
				quality while making our design and development processes more

				The Shared UI has a core team of designers and developers inside WPMU

		<div className="csb-block">
			<h3 className="csb-block__title">How we work</h3>
			<p>
				The following set of essential rules allows us to get to the highest
				level of productivity while benefiting the company and our team members.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					We avoid meetings as much as possible. Instead of having them, we
					communicate asynchronously to each other via Slack and Figma,
					expecting responses within 24 hours top.
				</li>
				<li>
					We don't do team-wide standups or sync meetings, except for one
					session at the start of every cycle. Here we walk through the tasks
					and discuss how the team feels, what motivates them right now and what
					they would want to change.
				</li>
				<li>
					Most collaboration and discussion happens in feedback loops, using the
					above Atlassian tools like JIRA, which requires clear and thoughtful
					communication from everyone.
				</li>
				<li>
					We don't have strict deadlines. We ship our changes as we move through
					the backlog and cycles in JIRA and launch new things as they become
					ready.
				</li>
				<li>
					Our team members should be able to work on what they think is fun or
					rely on their intuition when picking tasks from the backlog. Our{' '}
					<strong>design system roadmap</strong> holds us accountable.
				</li>
				<li>We focus on persistent iteration over flashy launches.</li>
